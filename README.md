An analysis on the 2016 presidential election to determine how high of an accuracy voter behavior predictions, such as classifying in a minority or upper class, can determine the outcome of an election. 

Voter behavior prediction (and thus election forecasting) can be a hard problem because there are numerous
random variables that need to be accounted for in terms of what a voter will decide or say. These variables tend to be immeasurable since they rely on a voter's background and mindset, leaving it not easy to develop predictions considering the constant change in state and national economy, or changes in societal conditions, etc.

Ultimately, there are many factors that need to be considered, but not all of them are easily predicted, leading to errors that can have drastic changes in the overall election forecasting.
