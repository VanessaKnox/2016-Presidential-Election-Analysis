##Conclusions
Gradient Boosting performed the worst with an error value close to 1. However, Boostrap Aggregating and Random Forests both contained similar low test errors and proved to be the best models for predicting the outcome of an election. The model maintained a 96% accuracy rate when tested against the test set.
